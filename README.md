About Me:

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Kristen, a passionate software enthusiast with a unique journey that has led me to the world of technology. Two years ago, while working as a dedicated air traffic controller, I embarked on a self-taught journey into the realm of software development. This decision was driven by my unwavering curiosity and the desire to challenge myself in a new field.

ðŸ›« As I continued to refine my skills during my tenure in air traffic control, I found myself increasingly drawn to the world of coding and problem-solving. This fascination eventually led me to take the bold step of transitioning into a full-time software engineering student in June of 2023. Embracing this new path, I've passionately delved into the intricacies of coding, development methodologies, and building robust applications.

ðŸŽ“ On September 15, 2023, I'll be proudly graduating from Code Platoon's intensive Full Stack Software Engineering program. This immersive experience has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of Python, Django, JavaScript, React, CSS, HTML, and Postgres. Through hands-on projects and collaborative efforts, I've honed my skills in crafting dynamic and user-friendly web applications.

ðŸš€ Looking ahead, I'm eagerly pursuing opportunities to launch my career as a Junior Software Engineer. My extensive journey has endowed me with a diverse skill set and a unique perspective on problem-solving. In addition to my technical abilities, I hold a SAFe certification that reflects my dedication to maintaining high standards of development practices.

ðŸŒŸ I'm excited to contribute my skills and passion to the dynamic world of software engineering. If you're seeking an enthusiastic team player who combines adaptability, technical prowess, and a proven commitment to growth, I'd love to connect!

Feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn or email at kristendescant01@gmail.com. Let's explore how my journey and skills can add value to your team and projects.
